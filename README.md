# 🧠 Pro ATS - Resume Matcher using Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM Model

🚀 Live App: [Pro ATS](https://pro-ats.streamlit.app/)

Pro ATS is a powerful AI-based resume matcher designed to assist recruiters and job seekers. It leverages Google's **Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM** to analyze and match resumes with job descriptions using semantic understanding, not just keyword matching.

## 💡 How It Works

Pro ATS evaluates your resume against a job description using a large language model to assess:

- **Relevance**
- **Skill alignment**
- **Experience match**
- **Formatting feedback**
- **Suggestions for improvement**

The app outputs:

- A **scorecard** indicating how well your resume fits the job.
- A **detailed explanation** powered by Gemini Pro 2.5.
- Actionable **recommendations** for improvement.
